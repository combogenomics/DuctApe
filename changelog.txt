Version 0.13.0
==============

UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH, pangenome combined analysis have been changed to account for distant species

The pathway maps and combined analysis have been remodulated to consider also the presence of genes that are not orthologs but share the same metabolic function (i.e. KEGG reaction ID).
There are virtually no changes for pangenomic analyses on closely-related strains, as their metabolic variability is mainly based on orthology relationships.
The KEGG reaction IDs that are common to all strains are labelled as 'conserved', as opposed to the 'variable' ones.

FEATURES:
* dgenome stats/export: new outputs and graphs for conserved/variable reactions
* dape map: new pathway coloring policies for pangenomes
	* Blue boxes means conserved reaction
	* Orange boxes mean variable reactions (color intensity proportional to strains count)
* dape start: consider conserved/variable reactions in the analysis
	* -n option removed

BUGFIXES:
* dphenome: the commands that need phenotypic data will exit if no PM plate is available

Version 0.12.0
==============

	* The 'area' parameter is greater in longer PM curves, even if the curve shape is equal
* dphenome purge: new purging policy ('replica') to remove a distinct replica by its ID
* dape, dgenome, dphenome start: new option (-y) to fetch kegg data with unstable connections

* dphenome start: support older scipy versions
* dphenome start: support newer scikits.learn versions
* dape, dgenome, dphenome start: correctly exit when kegg data fetch fails
